# Wumpus_Project 
Project of the course Artificial Intelligence at UU.

- The world generator is used for generating new world scenarios for the agent.
- Inside Wumpus_World/src/main/java there are two agents, either agent in fully observable environment where search and planning is performed in advance, or agent for partially observable environment where agent combines search and logic.
- ManualAI can be used for playing the game manually, and randomAI implements an agent that plays randomly.
